<p><em>The Registan and its three madrasahs. From left to right: Ulugh Beg Madrasah, Tilya-Kori Madrasah and Sher-Dor Madrasah.</em></p>
<h3>Public Square</h3>
<p>The Registan was a public square, where people gathered to hear royal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called dzharchis - and a place of public executions. It is framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture.</p>
<h3>Madrasahs</h3>
<p>The three madrasahs of the Registan are: the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417-1420), the Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646-1660) and the Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619-1636). Madrasah is an Arabic term meaning school.</p>
<h3>Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417-1420)</h3>

The corners are flanked by high minarets. The mosaic panel over the iwan&#39;s entrance arch is decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The square courtyard includes a mosque and lecture rooms, and is fringed by the dormitory cells in which students lived. There are deep galleries along the axes. Originally the Ulugh Beg Madrasah was a two-storied building with four domed darskhonas (lecture rooms) at the corners.
The Ulugh Beg Madrasah was one of the best clergy universities of the Muslim Orient in the 15th Century CE. Islamic scholar Abdurakhman Djami, a prominent poet, scientist and philosopher studied at the madrasah. Ulugh Beg himself gave lectures there. During Ulugh Beg&#39;s government the madrasah was a centre of secular science.</p>
<h3>Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619-1636)</h3>
<p><img src="http://azik.me/android/blank.gif" alt="Sher-Dor Madrasah"> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Lion%28or_tiger%29_on_the_Sher-dor_madrassa.JPG/200px-Lion%28or_tiger%29_on_the_Sher-dor_madrassa.JPG" alt="Sher-Dor Madrasah"> In the 17th century the ruler of Samarkand, Yalangtush Bakhodur, ordered the construction of the Sher-Dor and Tillya-Kori madrasahs. The Sher-Dor (Having Tigers) Madrasah was designed by the architect Abdujabor. The decoration of the madrasah is not as refined as that on the Ulugh Beg madrasah of the 15th century - the &quot;golden age&quot; of Timurid Samarkand architecture. Yet the harmony of large and small rooms, exquisite mosaic decor, monumentality and efficient symmetry, all place the structure among the finest architectural monuments of Samarkand.</p>
<h3>Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646-1660)</h3>
<p><img src="http://azik.me/android/blank.gif" alt="Tilya-Kori Madrasah"> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Tilla-Kori_Madrasah.jpg/200px-Tilla-Kori_Madrasah.jpg" alt="Tilya-Kori Madrasah"> Ten years later the Tilya-Kori (&quot;Gilded&quot;) Madrasah was built. It was not only a residential college for students, but also played the role of grand masjid (mosque). It has a two-storied main facade and a vast courtyard fringed by dormitory cells, with four galleries along the axes. The mosque building (see picture) is situated in the western section of the courtyard. The main hall of the mosque is abundantly gilded.</p>
<h3>Chorsu</h3>
<p>The ancient trading dome Chorsu is situated right behind the Sher-Dor. Now it is well restored.</p>
